## SESSIONS

### 2026-07-03 — Session 1: project bootstrap → v0.1.0 build
- /start → new project; Phase 1 brain dump supplied as two files
  (TREASURY_PROJECT_BRIEF.md + TREASURY_DECISIONS_LOG.md); no re-interrogation.
- 12 decisions seeded verbatim into DECISIONS.md as LOCKED.
- BUILD APPROVED: 7-gate roadmap v0.1.0 → v1.0.0 (0.34x operator calibration,
  with stated caveat that the pool contains no AWS/Terraform projects).
- Phases 4/5 (mockups/frontend) marked N/A permanently — backend-only project.
- v0.1.0: CONFIRMED → ROADMAP APPROVED → built (queue_worker_stage first per
  Brian's instruction) → verification green → gate-close docs written.
- Background grounding workflow (8 agents) verified provider syntax before HCL
  was written; its HIGH finding (aws_ecr_image.id vs image_digest) recorded in
  ARCHITECTURE.md known-unknowns for v0.2.0.
- Toolchain installed project-locally (.tools/bin: terraform 1.15.7,
  tflint 0.63.1; checkov via pip). aws CLI 2.35.15 installed by Brian
  (default path; not on Git Bash PATH — Terraform reads ~/.aws/credentials
  directly regardless). IAM user treasury-cli + AdministratorAccess.
- Region aligned us-east-1 → us-east-2; `terraform plan` clean (74/0/0).

### 2026-07-03 — Session 1 (cont.): v0.2.0 Component A
- v0.2.0: CONFIRMED → /critical-thinker on the idempotency store (DEC-13) →
  ROADMAP APPROVED → test-first build → green.
- Critical-thinker (isolated subagent) surfaced two HIGH design holes before any
  code: reject-vs-replay, and a two-phase silent-loss window. Both closed in the
  design and turned into test cases.
- Chose hand-rolled DynamoDB conditional write + status field over AWS Lambda
  Powertools (visible mechanism = stronger commitment-1 evidence); reversible.
- Test deps installed: pytest 9.1.1, moto 5.2.2, boto3 1.35.49 (user site).
